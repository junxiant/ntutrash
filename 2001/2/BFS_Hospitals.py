        paths[node] = {}    # each node will have their own dictionary/hashmap to store the paths to the source hospital
                            # in the form { source_hospital: predecessor}
#   for example:
#
#           0           k = 2
#            \          hospitals: 1, 6
#         4   1
#        / \ / \

#          / \
#         6   8
#          \
#           7
#
#    **** The reason there are 2 sets of {source_hospital: predecessor} in the dictionary is because k = 2
#    **** so the 2 are the nearest hospital and the path connecting the node to the hospital.
#    **** To trace the path back to that hospital, you just follow keep tracing the predecessor until you reach.
#
#       node number -> {source_hospital: predecessor, source_hospital: predecessor}
#     paths = { node 0 -> { 1: 1, 6: 1 },
#               node 1 -> { 1: 1, 6: 3 },
#               node 2 -> { 1: 1, 6: 1 },
#               node 3 -> { 1: 1, 6: 6 },
#               node 4 -> { 6: 3, 1: 3 },
#               node 5 -> { 6: 4, 1: 4 },
#               node 6 -> { 6: 6, 1: 3 },
#               node 7 -> { 6: 6, 1: 6 },
#               node 8 -> { 6: 3, 1: 3 }
#               }
#       So the 2 nearest hospitals for node 0 are 1 and 6. To get to hospital 1, you have to follow the
#       predecessor using the key of the source_hospital (which is 1 in this case). To reach node 1, the key will be 1.
#       key 1 for node 0 points to node 1, and that's the path to hospital 1. The second nearest hospital is hospital 6.
#       To reach hospital 6, the key used will be 6.
#       key 6 for node 0 points to node 1
#       key 6 for node 1 points to node 3
#       key 6 for node 3 points to node 6
#       And you have traced the path back to hospital 6.
#       Try applying this to the other nodes and see how each of them trace back to the respective hospitals.
