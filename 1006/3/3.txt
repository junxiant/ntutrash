6)	









Q: which is the transmitter used to transmit data.
A: arduino board
●	Serial Monitor can also use to transmit data

Q: what is the buffer in the transmitter and receiver for?
A:mitigate

Q: transmitter has been configured with 7O1. if transmitter baud rate is slower than receiver by half whats the data you'll receive using either (odd/even) parity
transmits 0x7A ('z')
A: should be 0x18 with either
(error/no error) in parity

Q: if T=~17.3µs what is the baud rate


Q: list the logic level of IDLE, START & STOP
A: High, Low, high

Q: parity is used to detect?
A: error detection

Q: how many cps for a 7bit data w 1 bit parity on a system thats 9600 Baudrate
A: 7bit data + 1 bit parity + 1 start +1 stop = 10 bit
9600/10 = 960






2 kbytes = 2048 bytes.
Transmission of a byte requires:
●	1 start bit
●	8 bits = actual byte
●	1 bit parity
●	2 bits stop
Total of 12 bits.
The baud is 2048 * 12 = 24576 baud
