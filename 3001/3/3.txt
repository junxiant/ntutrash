1. Can reduce cpi using pipeline alone. F

2. WriteEnable must be pipelined if only R instr executed. F

3. Value of X1 = 10. All other = 0. Calculate target data memory addr of D instr "00A04305".
Check if instr is I, R, D, etc
op=5(0000 0000 101)11bits
address= 4 (0 0000 0100) 9bits
Op2 = 0 (00)
Rn(Des) = 18 (11000)5bits
Rt = 0 0101

Load into target data memory address = Address + Rn = 4+0=4
Ans is 4 as it ask for target data memory address

4. 
2 statements back to back with no NOPs.
1st: only execute 2nd statement with INITIAL values. (Value is old because no NOP - Data dependency)
2nd: execute both statements with UPDATED values after each statement.
